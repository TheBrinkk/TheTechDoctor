# Cloud Hosting

# Summary
## Goal
> Have a virtual machine/network to remote into. goal is to make dumb terminals that can use the cloud instead of hardware. Quickbooks in the cloud is also another priority. 

I have seen 2 different options, manually through Microsoft Azure using the portal or can be done programmatically but for such custom solutions i dont see a reason to automate it yet. 

With Azure, the Azure portal is used manually to create what you need. I am not sure about how the resource management/billing would work out but im sure it would be reported. 

Azure Stack is Infrastructure-as-a-Service and provides a portal to setup plans and offers and etc. This would allow a customer to setup/signup and manage plans as well as their users and permissions.
It is basically a SDK for creating VMs and etc on the fly but also has its drawbacks, it is basically a private cloud network.
